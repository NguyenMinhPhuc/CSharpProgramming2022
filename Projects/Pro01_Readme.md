## 5 Skill
* .Net Framework. This is a Microsoft Windows framework designed specifically for promoting interoperability across programming languages. Since C# is predominantly used for Microsoft applications, you will learn how to build on the .Net Framework and modify it to meet any type of development requirements you have. 
* Object Oriented Programming. Learning object oriented programming (OOP) in C# does more than just shorten development time and increase flexibility. It also makes it easier for you to understand other object oriented programming languages like Python, JavaScript, Java, and PHP.  
* Frontend and Backend Knowledge. While C# isn’t exclusively a front end or backend programming language, it can easily be used for both server and client-side development. As a result, using this programming language can assist you in exploring and mastering full stack application development.
* Microsoft SQL Server. During some of your C# projects, you will use the Microsoft SQL Server, a vital part of the company’s technological architecture. It is a relational database that is ideal for data storage and retrieval across the software. It plays a crucial role in enterprise application processing. 
* Coding. Apart from improving your OOP skills, practicing your C# projects will also help you improve your overall coding skills. You will master coding with C# and other related technologies. This gives you more options as an advanced developer because it makes learning other programming languages in the C family, and beyond, easier.
